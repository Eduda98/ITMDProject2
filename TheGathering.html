<p>Magic: The Gathering, known colloquially as Magic, or MtG, was created by Richard Garfield in 1993. It was the first ever trading card game and boasts over 20 million players worldwide.</p>

<p>The Gathering hosts weekly events on Monday nights, from 6:30PM to 11:30PM in the Yellow Room in MTCC, as well as draft and sealed events that require no previous collection! Come check us out whether you're an old pro, a beginner, or just want to see what the game's all about!</p>
